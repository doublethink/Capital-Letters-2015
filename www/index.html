                    <h3>Waving or drowning? Thriving in a world of listicles, astroturfers and instachat</h3>
                    In a word of near ubiquitous access to the information worldwide, the way we think about learning is changing exponentially. (R)evolutions in our understanding of how we grasp new ideas, combined with the way we use digital technologies, means that educators are reimagining what communication, creation and school environments might be. If our students can access what they need when they need it online, publishing multimedia at the touch of a button, what does this mean for the way our students learn about making and creating meaning? We can talk to colleagues across the world through social networks 24-7 - so what does it mean for professional learning to pull up a chair in a virtual staffroom?<br><br>Karen will paint a picture of changing practices and new possibilities for the education profession and invite you to consider the place of the English teacher within it.</p>

An award-winning poet, she has published two books of poetry and is widely anthologized.   “Dream Fish Floating” won the best first book of poetry prize at the Montana Book Awards 2005.  Karlo's PhD focused on the culture, identity and wellbeing of NZ-born Pacific population.<br><br>Her postdoctoral research involved developing “Mana Moana” an indigenous wellbeing intervention targeted at Pacific young people.   This collated widely shared Pacific archetypes, generative concepts, words, associated proverbs, narratives, and myths, and underpinned by Pacific philosophies of health and wellbeing.  This has been woven into an accessible group-work programme called “the Journey to Motutapu" (sacred islands).  The aim was to ignite and transmit ancestral knowledge to Pacific youth and strengthen cultural identity and sense of legacy and purpose. This programme was tested for feasibility and accessibility with Wesley College prefects.<br><br>Karlo has an MSW (Applied) and worked as the Manager, Pacific Health Research, at the Health Research Council of New Zealand.  She has been an Op-Ed columnist for the Dominion-Post, worked as a Union Organiser and was secondary school teacher in Tonga.

                        <p>Have you considered ditching the textbook or homework book when teaching parts of speech? How can students remember all eight terms and what their purpose is in a sentence? You've heard of the poems, songs and raps that are supposed to help students, but if students aren't active in their own learning process, how will their recall fare the following year, or the year after that?<br><br>In this session, you will actively participate in a memory technique whereby each part of speech will be paired with a boxing move. Together they become a memory peg (a concept developed by Dr Rich Allen. ULearn13).<br><br>By the end of the session, you will have a template sentence using all parts of speech. Once taught, this technique needs to be repeated as a drill or a “warm-up” with students working in pairs. Alternatively, students can face the same direction and punch whichever sequence the teacher calls, all at the same time.<br><br>It has potential to be developed further to teach sentence types.</p>

                        <p>Based on my 2014 Master's thesis, I will present a range of strategies to promote Pasifika student achievement in English. The strategies are based on existing New Zealand and international literature and my own research in two large central Auckland secondary schools. The schools have significant numbers of Pasifika students on their rolls. My research identified effective teachers and interviewed them and their students about what "works" for Pasifika students in Level 2 English. I will also present information about how I am using the findings to raise achievement in English and Science in my school.</p>

                        <p>Reciprocal Teaching is a reading comprehension strategy proven to have a significant impact on a student’s ability to better engage with and gain meaning from unfamiliar texts. Students construct shared meaning through group discussion as they predict, question, clarify and summarise. As a student gains confidence in the use of strategies that effective readers use and internalises these, they are more able to apply them to their own independent reading.<br><br>Students are regularly required to read challenging and unfamiliar texts across all learning areas, however, there are standards in English that specifically assess a student’s ability to comprehend the purpose and audience, ideas, language features and/or structure of unfamiliar texts. This workshop will explore the use of reciprocal teaching as a tool to enhance student understanding in those standards and it will also consider it as a strategy to develop the skills and confidence that students require to make meaning of unfamiliar written material in English and across the curriculum.</p>

                        <p>The Senior English Curriculum Guide places a firm emphasis on “identity” as a core aspect of English teaching. In two separate pieces of research on teaching in the secondary English classroom in New Zealand, the two presenters of this workshop, PhD candidate and English teacher Liana MacDonald and her supervisor at Victoria University Gillian Hubbard, heard differing interpretations and responses to Patricia Grace’s iconic short story Butterflies, from differing school contexts. We have been thinking as a result about those issues of student ability to express, or even reveal, their own perspectives and beliefs in the diverse contexts of teaching in New Zealand. In this workshop we will play around with some poems, short stories and extracts from novels taught in the English classroom, thinking in an exploratory way about identity and sometimes hidden identity.</p>

And are we planning our workload so that we can thrive as  effective and efficient teachers?<br><br>In this practical workshop, we will look at ways to strategically plan from year 9 to year 13. The workshop suggests a range of effective ways of teaching content  as well as practical suggestions for managing marking and feedback.<br><br>The workshop celebrates poetry, close reading, the essay, rigourous text choices and a fair few children’s picture books.</p>

Hundreds if not thousands of similar letters exist. Can they be viewed as attempts to provide succour to families at home in times of despair or an important glimpse into the thoughts, emotions and motivations of those who went to war?</p>

So what do you do when students say they’d rather eat earwax jellybeans than attend a dull lesson? Yes …indeed … you respond by purring loudly and contentedly, knowing that your lessons are fun, exciting and do not involve ‘solving for x’. But how do you keep them that way? This workshop shares tips from my toolbox of teaching tricks to ensure that your lessons are ‘the bomb’, ‘the hydrogen jukebox’, and so ‘uber-cool’, they’re practically a popsicle. Specifically, in this workshop we will look at quick ‘do now’ games, activities to get students learning while out of their seats, novel uses of technology and entertaining exit strategies.</p>

However, using tough love, IT tricks, bribery and my passion for the bard, I can usually turn them around and get the students grudgingly admitting: “Maybe I like Shakespeare after all”.<br><br>I would like to ‘share the love,’ and pass on some ideas which have been successful for me, including drama circles, social media, Kahoot quizzes, video commentaries, debates and good old-fashioned ‘chalk and talk’.<br><br>The workshop will be mainly based on my Level 3 Shakespeare Unit where we study Hamlet and then students complete a research essay for AS 91479 - 3.8 Develop an informed understanding of literature and/or language using critical texts.<br><br>Jess Wilson is HOD English at Otaki College.</p>

                        <p>Location: BG6</p>
                        <p>Using the conventions, elements and techniques of Drama can enable greater buy in to English activities, facilitating enhanced comprehension of many English skills ranging from literacy, through to NCEA understanding of film, literature and unfamiliar texts and effective oral presentations. Performance does not need to be a scary thing and in this workshop I will discuss how to create a safe and supportive class environment so as students have the confidence to partake in performance-based activities, as well modelling some exercises that you can use in your own classroom. Workshop participants will be getting involved! Using performance can do wonders for helping students to connect to characters and themes as well learning the most basic grammatical concepts. Drama will bring energy and fun into the English class. Allowing students to be creative, empathetic, enthusiastic and switched into the wonderful world of English!</p>

                        <p>As English teachers, we are well used to pulling text apart, to look for themes, revelations, metaphors and connection. Traditionally though, literary criticism has paid less attention to narrative: how it's constructed, what the tricks of the trade are, how the flow of the narrative affect us and why (film criticism, by contrast, pays much closer attention to narrative devices). In this workshop, I intend to come at narrative from a writer's perspective, and using some well known texts, look at how we might go about talking about and teaching the construction of narrative tension.</p>

Megan Nelson-Latu will talk about the digital journey and how Chromebooks are being used to enhance the teaching and learning process. Jess Wilson will talk about her experience coming into the project this year with her Year 10 English class.<br><br>The journey can be encapsulated by the fact that while Jess has felt at times this year that she is ‘going down the Googler’, Megan is at the point where she would have a nervous breakdown if she had to go back to pen and paper in her classroom!<br><br>The workshop will include hands-on and practical tips as well as discussion. We will share some Google Apps we are using in our programmes, such as: Docs, Drawings, Forms, research tools, Kahoot and other digital tools for literacy.</p>

                        <p>Location: B24</p>
                        <p>This year, we offered our students English courses such as 'Maori Voices in English', 'Sport and English', 'Dystopia', 'Makeup and Beauty', 'Gaming in English', 'Pasifika Studies', ‘Persuasion’, ‘Creative Writing’, ‘Journalism and Media’.... the list goes on. In order to offer more choices, some of our classes have Year11-13 students assessed at Levels 1-3. Each class is only three hours per week and some students are taking two or three English classes. The year has been a huge challenge, but we are committed to the change. We are working on new courses for next year such as 'Deaf Studies', 'English and the Undead', 'English and Oppression'.... it has been a wonderful experience in ‘keeping it fresh’ but we are working like we each did in our first year of teaching! This workshop is about showing you how we changed the programme, how we have encouraged students to have an input into course design, and why we don’t want to give up on the changes we have made.</p>

                        <p>Providing teenagers, particularly boys, with a choice in what they are reading has an impact on their engagement. The presentation will focus on an idea I got from a Young Adult Literature class I participated in whilst on a Fulbright Scholarship in Bloomington, Indiana, USA in 2014. I wanted to find out how digital tools aided literacy development in struggling secondary students, particularly non-reading boys. What I found was that despite having iPads available in the class, it was CHOICE that made the difference. The session will go through how I have adapted this idea to a New Zealand context. Participants will be given ideas of ways they can incorporate “Book groups” and “Choices” into their junior English programmes.</p>

                        <p>While working as a secondary school English teacher and now employed by the Department of Corrections, I was, and continue to be, challenged by perceptions, attitudes and discourses connected to dysfunctional whanau life, including domestic violence, and how to address these.<br><br>Although we might agree about the sensitivities involved, there is much debate about whether we should teach texts that deal with the topics or allow our learners to research them. We consider whether to create/preserve an illusion of childhood; whether to provide a space of gritty reality or whether, for personal reasons to avoid such topics.<br><br>In both my personal life and within my teaching contexts, I have had to confront such decisions and to work through the inherent challenges.<br><br>In this workshop, I will outline some of my ideas and experiences and to open up the floor for a discussion on the pros and cons of addressing whanau/intimate partner violence and dysfunction as well as helpful teaching strategies.</p>

                        <p>A "Lifelong Learner" is an independent thinker: one who has the ability to acknowledge their own bias whilst being receptive to the possibilities of other truths, beliefs and positions. To empower students to critically think about the world in which they live, is an essential part of this life-long learning process. This workshop will provide personal, practical strategies to further implement the work of Dr Susan Sandretto (University of Otago) on critical literacy, in Junior and Senior classrooms. The workshop will present additional resources and evidence of students' critical discussion in current contexts: their enjoyment and engagement evident.</p>

                        <p>Many schools today are using ASTTLE tests as a diagnostic tool to inform teaching and learning. Some schools are using ASTTLE to report back to parents or to ensure accurate placement of students. But, ASTTLE is more than that. ASTTLE is not just one more test that we do and forget about it.<br><br>This session will provide you with relevant, practical and user friendly activities and processes that you can apply in your teaching on a daily basis. It will teach you how to read students' results, what specific strategies to apply in order to target and improve specific areas and particular skills. You will learn how to differentiate, where to look for answers and how to cater for top / bottom groups in your class. It will give you ideas how to go about goal setting - for your individual student and the class as a whole.<br><br>The best thing is - that you can learn how to engage with other teachers from other subject areas; it is a shared responsibility, not the responsibility of English teachers.</p>
